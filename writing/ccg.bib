This combined system of syntactic parser and dependency structure annotation is compared to two hand-crafted, deep constraint-based parsers, RASP and XLE. We evaluate using dependency-based gold standards and use the Approximate Randomization Test to test the statistical significance of the results. Our experiments show that machine-learning-based shallow grammars augmented with sophisticated automatic dependency annotation technology outperform hand-crafted, deep, wide-coverage constraint grammars.

  Abstract                 = {This article describes a number of log-linear parsing models for an automatically extracted lexicalized grammar. The models are ?full? parsing models in the sense that probabilities are defined for complete parses, rather than for independent events derived by decomposing the parse tree. Discriminative training is used to estimate the models, which requires incorrect parses for each sentence in the training data as well as the correct parse. The lexicalized grammar formalism used is Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG), and the grammar is automatically extracted from CCGbank, a CCG version of the Penn Treebank. The combination of discriminative training and an automatically extracted grammar leads to a significant memory requirement (up to 25 GB), which is satisfied using a parallel implementation of the BFGS optimization algorithm running on a Beowulf cluster. Dynamic programming over a packed chart, in combination with the parallel implementation, allows us to solve one of the largest-scale estimation problems in the statistical parsing literature in under three hours. A key component of the parsing system, for both training and testing, is a Maximum Entropy supertagger which assigns CCG lexical categories to words in a sentence. The supertagger makes the discriminative training feasible, and also leads to a highly efficient parser. Surprisingly, given CCG's ?spurious ambiguity,? the parsing speeds are significantly higher than those reported for comparable parsers in the literature. We also extend the existing parsing techniques for CCG by developing a new model and efficient parsing algorithm which exploits all derivations, including CCG's nonstandard derivations. This model and parsing algorithm, when combined with normal-form constraints, give state-of-the-art accuracy for the recovery of predicate-argument dependencies from CCGbank. The parser is also evaluated on DepBank and compared against the RASP parser, outperforming RASP overall and on the majority of relation types. The evaluation on DepBank raises a number of issues regarding parser evaluation. This article provides a comprehensive blueprint for building a wide-coverage CCG parser. We demonstrate that both accurate and highly efficient parsing is possible with CCG. This article describes a number of log-linear parsing models for an automatically extracted lexicalized grammar.

While things were relatively quiet with the planning approach to NLG for a while, several recent publications have sparked a renewed interest in this area. In this paper, we investigate the extent to which these new NLG approaches profit from the advances in planner expressiveness and efficiency. Our findings are mixed. While modern planners can readily handle the search problems that arise in our NLG experiments, their overall runtime is often dominated by the grounding step they perform as preprocessing. Furthermore, small changes in the structure of a domain can significantly shift the balance between search and preprocessing. Overall, our experiments show that the off-the-shelf planners we tested are unusably slow for nontrivial NLG problem instances. As a result, we offer our domains and experiences as challenges for the planning community.},

SO-CAL is applied to the polarity classification task, the process of assigning a positive or negative label to a text that captures the text's opinion towards its main subject matter. We show that SO-CAL's performance is consistent across domains and in completely unseen data. Additionally, we describe the process of dictionary creation, and our use of Mechanical Turk to check dictionaries for consistency and reliability.},

  Abstract                 = {Empty categories (EC) are artiï¬cial elements in Penn Treebanks motivated by the government-binding (GB) theory to explain certain language phenomena such as pro-drop. ECs are ubiquitous in languages like Chinese, but they are tacitly ignored in most machine translation (MT) work because of their elusive nature. In this paper we present a comprehensive treatment of ECs by ï¬rst recovering them with a structured MaxEnt model with a rich set of syntactic and lexical features, and then incorporating the predicted ECs into a Chinese-to-English machine translation task through multiple approaches, including the extraction of EC-speciï¬c sparse features. We show that the recovered empty categories not only improve the word alignment quality, but also lead to signiï¬cant improvements in a large-scale state-of-the-art syntactic MT system.},

First, discourse plans must adequately represent the intentional structure of the utterances they produce in order to enable a computational discourse agent to respond effectively to communicative failures [15]. Second, discourse plans must represent the information structure of utterances. In addition to these representational requirements, we argue that discourse planners should be formally characterizable in terms of soundness and completeness.},

Prolog and Natural Language Analysis provides a concise and practical introduction to logic programming and the logic-programming language Prolog both as vehicles for understanding elementary computational linguistics and as tools for implementing the basic components of natural-language-processing systems. Throughout, the specific concepts and techniques are given rigorous theoretical justification and are demonstrated with working programs that show how Prolog can be used to solve actual problems in syntax, parsing, and semantic intepretation.These examples culminate in a simple working natural-language question-answering system written in Prolog. Extensive bibliographic notes point the reader to related research and further reading.Fernando C.N. Pereira is a senior computer scientist at SRI International's Artificial Intelligence Center and a consulting professor at Stanford University. His research on Prolog and natural-language processing underlies much recent work in logic grammars.Stuart Shieber is a researcher at the Center for the Study of Language and Information and a computer scientist at SRI International's Artificial Intelligence Center.

  Abstract                 = {Most current linguistic theories give lexical accounts of several phenomena that used to be considered purely syntactic. The information put in the lexicon is thereby increased both in amount and complexity. We explore the view that syntactic rules are not separated from lexical items. In this approach, each elementary structure is associated with a lexical item called the anchor. These structures specify extended domains of locality (as compared to context-free grammars) over which constraints can be stated. The 'grammar' consists of a lexicon where each lexical item is associated with a finite number of structures for which that item is the anchor. There are 'rules' which tell us how these structures are composed. A grammar of this form will be said to be lexicalized. The process of lexicalization of context-free grammars (CFGs) constrained by linguistic requirements forces us to use operations for combining structures that make the formalism fall in the class of mildly context sensitive languages. We show that substitution, the combining operation corresponding to CFGs, does not allow one to lexicalize CFGs but the combination of substitution and adjunction does. We show how tree-adjoining grammar (TAG) is derived from the lexicalization process of CFGs. Then we show that TAGs are closed under lexicalization and we illustrate the main structures found in a lexicalized TAG for English. The properties of TAGs permit us to encapsulate diverse syntactic phenomena in a very natural way. TAG's extended domain of locality and its factoring of recursion from local dependencies enable us to localize many syntactic dependencies (such as filler-gap) as well as semantic dependencies (such as predicate-arguments). We investigate the processing of lexicalized TAGs. We first present two general practical parsers that follow Earley-style parsing. They are practical parsers for TAGs because, as for CFGs, the average behavior of Earley-type parsers is superior to its worst case complexity. They are both left to right bottom-up parsers that use top-down predictions but they differ in the way the top down prediction is used. Then we explain the building of a set of deterministic bottom-up left to right parsers which analyze a subset of tree-adjoining languages. The LR parsing strategy for CFGs is extended to TAG by using a machine, called Bottom-up Embedded Push Down Automaton (BEPDA), that recognizes in a bottom-up fashion the set of tree-adjoining languages (and exactly this set). Finally we show how lexicalized grammars suggest a natural two-step parsing strategy. We consider lexicalized TAGs as an instance of lexicalized grammar and we examine the effect of the two-step parsing strategy on main types of parsing algorithms.},

  Abstract                 = {We present the PHATT algorithm for plan recognition. Unlike previous approaches to plan recognition, PHATT is based on a model of plan execution. We show that this clarifies several difficult issues in plan recognition including the execution of multiple interleaved root goals, partially ordered plans, and failing to observe actions. We present the PHATT algorithm's theoretical basis, and an implementation based on tree structures. We also investigate the algorithm's complexity, both analytically and empirically. Finally, we present PHATT's integrated constraint reasoning for parametrized actions and temporal constraints.},

  abstract = {Current source code analyses driving software maintenance tools treat methods as either a single unit or a set of individual statements or words. They often leverage method names and any existing internal comments. However, internal comments are rare, and method names do not typically capture the methodâs multiple high-level algorithmic steps that are too small to be a single method, but require more than one statement to implement.
Previous work demonstrated feasibility of identifying high level actions automatically for loops; however, many high level actions remain unaddressed and undocumented, particularly sequences of consecutive statements that are associated with each other primarily by object references. We call these object-related action units.
In this paper, we present an approach to automatically generate natural language descriptions of object-related action units within methods. We leverage the available, large source of high-quality open source projects to learn the templates of object-related actions, identify the statement that can represent the main action, and generate natural language descriptions for these actions. Our evaluation study of a set of 100 object-related statement sequences showed promise of our approach to automatically identify the action and arguments and generate natural language descriptions.}

  abstract  = {Most software engineering tasks require developers to understand parts of the source code. When faced with unfamiliar code, developers often rely on (internal or external) documentation to gain an overall understanding of the code and determine whether it is relevant for the current task. Unfortunately, the documentation is often absent or outdated. This paper presents a technique to automatically generate human readable summaries for Java classes, assuming no documentation exists. The summaries allow developers to understand the main goal and structure of the class. The focus of the summaries is on the content and responsibilities of the classes, rather than their relationships with other classes. The summarization tool determines the class and method stereotypes and uses them, in conjunction with heuristics, to select the information to be included in the summaries. Then it generates the summaries using existing lexicalization tools. A group of programmers judged a set of generated summaries for Java classes and determined that they are readable and understandable, they do not include extraneous information, and, in most cases, they are not missing essential information.},

In order to simplify the construction of documentation generators, we introduce island grammars, which only define those syntactic structures needed for (re)documentation purposes. We explain how they can be used to obtain various forms of documentation, such as data dependency diagrams for mainframe batch jobs. Moreover, we discuss how the derived information can be made available via a hypertext structure. We conclude with an industrial case study in which a 600,000 LOC COBOL legacy system is redocumented using the techniques presented in the paper},

    abstract = "The main obstacle to incremental sentence processing arises from right-branching constituent structures, which are present in the majority of English sentences, as well as optional constituents that adjoin on the right, such as right adjuncts and right conjuncts. In CCG, many right-branching derivations can be replaced by semantically equivalent left-branching incremental derivations. The problem of right-adjunction is more resistant to solution, and has been tackled in the past using revealing-based approaches that often rely either on the higher-order unification over lambda terms (Pareschi and Steedman,1987) or heuristics over dependency representations that do not cover the whole CCGbank (Ambati et al., 2015). We propose a new incremental parsing algorithm for CCG following the same revealing tradition of work but having a purely syntactic approach that does not depend on access to a distinct level of semantic representation. This algorithm can cover the whole CCGbank, with greater incrementality and accuracy than previous proposals.",
