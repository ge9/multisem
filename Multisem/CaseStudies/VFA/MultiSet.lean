  /- Note: VFA does a lot of this definition of short-hands for types,
     which interacts poorly with Lean's typeclass inference. Marking
     things `@[simp]` is supposed to make them transparent to typeclass
     inference, but this doesn't always work.
     On one hand this is a pain, on the other hand it's a good indication
     that doing this *outside* the proof assistant could be even worse,
     because in that setting you'd have to duplicate the equivalence checking
     in an external tool

      This instance feels slightly over-specialized, like it should be derivable from a more general property.
      It seems to be in the same spirit as e.g. `Multisem.Grammar.Jacobson.ZRR`, but the version of Jacobson's
      work I took that from (Gerhard 2005) didn't address anaphora across coordinators.

  /- TODO: To finish this batch of specs, I really need
     - support for multiple named variables
     - support for 'the' to refer to a referent (named or unnamed) introduced by a quantifier 

     Ideally I could read a solution to the first straight out of Ranta, though I could probably just tweak Jacobson's approach to work with a "named NP" construct used only for the 'hole' with discourse referents, coupled with named-quantifier forms "any list l"). Plus a tag/decl typeclass for marking which identifiers can be converted to variable references (via a lexicon instance). This is basically two minor variations on a single extension, and gets us through this chapter's specs.
