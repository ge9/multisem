    /-
      These instances do a lot of work, but they're limited to depth one.
      Much of the difficulty and subtlety of grammatical treatments of anaphora is ensuring that arbitrary stacking is handled, regardless of depth, ordering, or repetition.
      The systems I've studied in detail (notably Jacobson's but seemingly also Moortgat's, and based on initial investigations Barker and Shan's) seem to handle this by allowing arbitrary lifting of "whole" fragments to assume compatibility with an arbitrary hole. But of course this blows up search pretty bad because a lot of time is wasted lifting terms that don't need it (and this is with her restriction to NP referents).

  /- TODO: Currently we have enough to do:
    "the contents of al equals the contents of bl if al is a permutation of bl"
    but we need to introduce the quantifiers.
    Doing this via "for any list al and any list bl" requires either special-casing 'for' in somem weird ways or preferably over-loading 'and' to conjoin quantifiers, ideally so the result looks for a sentence missing those two variables (in the right nesting order...)

    The alternative is to arrange for 'any list bl' to turn into a GQ in the appropriate way in 'the contents of any list al equal the contents of any list bl if ...'. This would really be the ideal approach, but the quantifier types seem quite complex... unless there's something crystal clear I missed in Steedman's Taking Scope. Long-term the ideal would be to implement Shan and Barker's continuation types, but this is too much of a detour for now.

         But there's no reason this should matter: it's just a right application! So one of several things must be happening:
         - AppGL doesn't fire unless this unit is already in scope
           + Seems pretty unlikely
         - This particular associativity isn't explored
