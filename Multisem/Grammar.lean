  We're dropping the div typeclass instance. Going this route adds noticeable overhead,
  so we've been using the custom `///` notation below, but leaving this instance open
  has caused issues with accidentally using `/` instead of `///` in lexicon entries,
  which then takes forever to track down...

    is to define the operator as a typeclass operation.
    When we do this for both left and right slash, it nearly doubles
    parse times. Defining ∖∖ directly in terms of `lslash` recovers half that slow-down. Can we redefine the / macro to avoid `HDiv`?
